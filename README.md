Labs for Embedded Software
This code is meant and optmized for a K70 embedded tower. This project is meant to showcase my K70 Embedded Project/Proficiency in Embedded C and is not meant for academic misconduct.
All code is sourced from hotfix branches on a development repo meaning that the code tends to follow best practices.
